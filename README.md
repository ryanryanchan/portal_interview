portal interview exercise


for the data structure I used an object to represent events, with a title,  date, start time, and end time.
I ran out of time but I wanted to use js datetimes to represent the events dates and times.

my algorithm sould use a nested for loop to check each event against every other one.
for all events with the same date
  if  start_time1 was after start_time2 and start_time1 was before end_time2
  if end_time1 was before end_time2 and end_time1 was after start_time1
  if start_time1 was before start_time2 and end_time1 was after end_time2
